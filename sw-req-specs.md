# Software Requirement Specifications (SRS)

**Commitment** 💪: Weekly Sprints

**Velocity** 🏃💨: A feature a week

**Capacity**: Just me 🤷

**Weekly scrum**:

* Week One (3 Feb 2020 - 9 Feb 2020) - Finish tooling. **Result**: Failed. Reasons were distraction and no external pressure. Last two days had external pressure and resulted in focussed work.
* Week Two (10 Feb 2020 - 16 Feb 2020) - Finish tooling (since not done in the last week). Create a basic CRUD app with basic front-end and with completely functional tooling.

**Daily scrum**:

* 10-02-2020
* 09-02-2020 - ESLint ships with create-react-app. Tried adding Prettier configs to ESLint. How to check if it is functional? Have included a *steps* file that lists all the steps that I am taking to build things.
* 08-02-2020 - Added a snazzy readme.md alongwith an MIT license to the project. The readme has all bells and whistles needed to make it look professional. Should be the final version of it barring minor changes. Created a react app with create-react-app. Installed npx and updated node, npm, etc.
