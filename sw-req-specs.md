# Software Requirement Specifications (SRS)

**Commitment** 💪: Weekly Sprints

**Velocity** 🏃💨: A feature a week

**Capacity**: Just me 🤷

**Weekly scrum**:

* Week One (3 Feb 2020 - 9 Feb 2020) - Finish tooling.

**Daily scrum**:

* 10-02-2020
* 09-02-2020 - ESLint ships with create-react-app. Tried adding Prettier configs to ESLint. How to check if it is functional? Have included a *steps* file that lists all the steps that I am taking to build things.
* 08-02-2020 - Added a snazzy readme.md alongwith an MIT license to the project. The readme has all bells and whistles needed to make it look professional. Should be the final version of it barring minor changes. Created a react app with create-react-app. Installed npx and updated node, npm, etc.
